<p>I am very much looking forward to understanding Ruby and Rails after I finish the three part Tea Leaf Academy Program.  I have done a lot of research and because I can't really afford to take 3 or 4 months out of my schedule to attend a program full time, I have decided to take an online bootcamp.  I may decide to go to a full time program after I do this, but it will depend on how much I have learned at the completion of the online version.  At the completion of my research it basically came down to two options:  Bloc and TeaLeaf Academy.  I decided to do both, however my wife recently had a stroke and I could not do both options.  I have withdrawn from the Bloc program and am going to continue with TeaLeaf.</p>

<p>After my wife had her stroke, I was unable to really do anything for about five full days.  I primarily worked with my wife in the hospital and through rehabilitation.  She is currently doing much better now and I am going to start trying to get caught up with the rest of my cohort starting today.  I have a long way to go, but I am confident I can do this.</p>

<p>I have really enjoyed the way the TeaLeaf program works so far.  The initial sessions were very informative, the materials are well laid out, however there are some severe challenges ahead for me.  My next post will be after I go through the week one materials and try to get caught up.</p>

<p>I am finishing up the first week and have realized that coming up with the logic to solve the various problems is very difficult.  I can understand what the lines of code do after I see the solutions, however coming up with the solutions from scratch is proving very difficult.  I am the type of person who typically likes to work through problems backwards as I find it easier to understand that way, however at some point in time I am going to have be able to solve these problems from scratch without being provided the solutions to work from.</p>
